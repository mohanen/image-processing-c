# image-processing-c

just some simple image processing programs in c language

The RGB to MONO means greyscale Conversion which reduces the image data size to 1/3

The RGB to MONO_COLOR is conversion of 24 BGR bit to custom 8 BGR format .. 2 bit  per color.

both this color conversion work with all bmp files and padding is handled and maintained.


The zoomx code only works with file with out padding i could have handled it but no time .

I also included a sample melon.bmp .
